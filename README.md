# SecurityPassGenX
Safe Password Generator

The SecurityPassGenX project is a password generation tool that empowers users to create robust and secure passwords. Users can customize their passwords by specifying the length and choosing criteria such as mixed characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, or symbols. Leveraging the random function from the random module, the program dynamically generates a unique password each time it's executed. Utilizing a combination of for and if-else loops for logic, this tool ensures that users can easily generate strong passwords to enhance security and protect against unauthorized access.
